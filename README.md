# WebDev

## Description

This is a small project based on the ficticious Horiseon Web Deevelopment firm. My aim is to stylize and create a well flowing webpage with elements of CSS. I am developing to follow logical structure and a proper and concise sequential order in how my code is written. This development is to show what I have learned in coding structure and management.

## Installation

No installation required.

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```

## Credits

List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.

If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section.

If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well.

## License

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).
