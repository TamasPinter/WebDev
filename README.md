# WebDev

## Description

This is a small project based on the ficticious Horiseon Web Deevelopment firm. My aim is to stylize and create a well flowing webpage with elements of CSS. I am developing to follow logical structure and a proper and concise sequential order in how my code is written. This development is to show what I have learned in coding structure and management.
